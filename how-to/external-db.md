# Using a External Database
For some reason you should like to connect your website to an external
database.  
For example, if you're working on several website, it can be a good idea
not to do a cron job on several servers.  
With this option, you can sync one website and connect the others sites
to this "main" website.
## Settings
To use an external database, simply fill credentials to this db.  
By using an external db, API credentials are not necessary on
"secondary" website as they won't sync on Awin.
