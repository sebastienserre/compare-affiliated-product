<h1><a id="Using_a_External_Database_0"></a>Using a External Database</h1>
<p>For some reasons you should like to connect your website to an external database.<br>
	For example, if you’re working on several websites, it can be a good idea not to do a cron job on several servers.<br>
	With this option, you can sync one website and connect the others sites<br>
	to this “main” website.</p>
<h2><a id="Settings_7"></a>Settings</h2>
<p>To use an external database, simply fill credentials to this db.<br>
	By using an external db, API credentials are not necessary on “secondary” website as they won’t sync on Awin.</p>
