<p>Compare Affiliated Products is coming with a folder called ‘aawp’ which<br>
	include all the aawp original template modified to display the products<br>
	from other affiliation platform.</p>
<h2><a id="How_to_customize_and_use_it_5"></a>How to customize and use it?</h2>
<p>If you customize directly the aawp folder inside the Compare Affiliated<br>
	Product plugin folder, you will loose all customization on next update.<br>
	To avoid it, please copy the aawp folder on you <strong>child</strong> theme root<br>
	folder.<br>
	If you already have a aawp folder in your child theme, you’ll have to<br>
	add the hook do_action( ‘thfo_compare_after_price’, $this ); where you<br>
	want to see the price comparaison.</p>
